## Code Release

This folder contains the code used to generate the results presented in our paper.

CBIG_Figure4_toy_ex_HMM.m           reproduces the results presented in Figure 4 of the referenced paper
CBIG_Figure7_toy_ex_bi_vs_multi.m   reproduces the results presented in Figure 7 of the referenced paper

Other results of the paper were obtained by combining autoregressive and phase randomization procedures. These procedures are implemented in CBIG_get_AR_surrogate.m and CBIG_get_PR_surrogate.m. Different options are detailed in the headers of the corresponding codes.
